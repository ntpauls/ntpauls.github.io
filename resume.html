  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>
  I’m a fourth-year Communication and Art double major. I attend Goshen College, a liberal arts school in Goshen, Indiana. During the spring semester of 2020, I studied abroad in Ecuador, leaving early due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I love telling stories and creating art that maximizes human connection.

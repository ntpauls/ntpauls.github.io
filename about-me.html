    <p>
    Hey! I'm Nathan Thomas Pauls. I grew up in the midst of rolling hills and Amish farms in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. I've loved art and creating things ever since I was young, always keeping a doodle book and working on lego stop-animations in my bedroom.
    <p>

    <p>
    In high school, I earned a spot on the staff of Millstream, the student newspaper. In the span of 4 years, went from a freshman cartoonist to a senior Features page editor.
    <p>
​
    <p>
    I continued my enthusiasm for writing at <a href="https://www.goshen.edu/"target="_blank">Goshen College</a>I've been a member of the college's <a href="https://record.goshen.edu/"target="_blank">The Record</a> for all of my three years. Starting my fourth year I will be Managing Editor for Digital Content. I've also been involved at the college's radio station <a href="https://globeradio.org/"target="_blank">91.1 The Globe</a> and this coming year I'll be second in command as Program Director.
    <p>

​    <p>
    Goshen helped me find my main passion, pottery. I love throwing on the wheel. Creating with clay gives me a sense of accomplishment, focus, and peace that I can't find anywhere else. Although I don't expect it to be my main line of work (at least not right away) I want to continue working with clay after college.
    <p>

​

    <p>That makes up a short life history, so here are some other fun facts about me:
    <p>

​

<ul>
  <li>
    I spent a semester studying and serving in Ecuador in the spring of 2020, but my group's time was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic
  </li>

  <li>
    I love drawing and the PILOT G-2 05 pen is my tool of choice.
  </li>

  <li>
    Tea is my favorite hot drink, which pairs well with my mug making ability.
  </li>
    I enjoy playing video games that go along with my creative spirit, Minecraft Stardew Valley.
  <li>
    Music is one of my favorite things. With 62,312 minutes listened on Spotify alone in 2020, I listen to music almost everywhere I go.
  </li>
</ul>

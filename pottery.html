      I have been seriously working with clay since my sophomore year of college, when I took ceramics I with Merrill Krabill at Goshen College. Since then, I've had a summer internship with Dennis Maust Ceramics in Lititz, Pennsylvania and served with a cermaic family business during my time studying abroad in Ecuador. Below you can find my work from the past several years.

    <br>

    <p>During the second semester of my junior year, I studied abroad in Ecuador. I was part of a group of students doing Goshen College's 12 week Study Service Term (SST). For the first 6 weeks, my group studied spanish and Ecuadorian culture, taking tours of the capital city of Quito and living with host families.

    <br>
    <br>

    The second 6 weeks, our group was split up and sent to different service location throughout the country. I was fortunate enough to be placed with a family ceramic business that makes miniture figurines based off of the traditional indigenous people of Ecuador. I spent jusst 3 weeks with the family after my time there was cut short when my group had to leave the country early due to COVID-19.  </p>

The first photo (above) is a detailed picture of the pots, the second shows the members of the 2020 monlouges group with the pots, which each got to keep.</p>

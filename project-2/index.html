          Started from friendships formed in the Goshen College dorm hall of Yoder 1 their first year, The Ratlings is a 4 man college jam band that loves to rock and groove. Their first official performance was during kickoff of their sophomore year when they wowed the crowd with their rendition of Teenage Dirtbag by Wheatus.

          The crowd pleasing continued the end of their sophomore year, when they broke into the Goshen house-show scene. They played high-volume shows covering the hits of Weezer, The Beatles, and many more. Sophomore and Junior year whizzed past, filled with house-shows and different band members filtering in and out. Fast-forward to this year, where the core four live together, frequently jamming and coming up with a few songs of their own.

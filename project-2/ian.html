          <b>Instrument you play in the band:</b> Bass <br />
          <b>Favorite flavor of anything:</b> I love lavender in coffee, soda, ice cream, soap etc. Slap some lavender in it and it’ll be an enjoyable experience for me.<br />
          <b>Best Ratlings-related memory:</b> The first house show fall of our sophomore year was awesome. I remember screaming Sabotage by the Beastie Boys at the top of my lungs and jumping around the stage. It was a blast.<br />
          <b>A way other than music you spend your free time:</b> I love practicing yoga at night. It helps me relax and feel more connected to my body.<br />
          <b>Best and worst thing about the instrument you play:</b> It’s great to have some control over the groove & harmony of a song, but it’s sometimes hard to hear myself.

          <b>Instrument you play in the band:</b> rhythm guitar and vocals if it's an original of mine<br />
          <b>Favorite flavor of anything:</b> I'm a bit fan of earthy scents/flavors. There's something about eating or sniffing a plant that really gets me good.<br />
          <b>Best Ratlings-related memory:</b> walking through the crowd after we had shaved our heads was a spectacular feeling. Seeing all the looks of shock and dismay was hilarious.<br />

        <b>A way other than music you spend your free time:</b> I like to longboard, hang out with friends, or spend time outside doing whatever.<br />
        <b>Best and worst thing about the instrument you play:</b> The only limitations on the guitar are the ones you put on it yourself. The worst part is that I'm not very good at virtuosic playing.

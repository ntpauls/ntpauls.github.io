<h2>Raleway</h2>

<p>Raleway was originally designed with a single thin weight by Matt McInerney. In 2012, the font was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?selection.family=Raleway&sidebar.open=true#about">(Raleway)</a> . It is inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces and is a stylistic alternate to default text face <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/raleway">(McInerney)</a>. In 2016 the design was thoroughly updated with new spacing added, a raised f bar, italics among with other features added.</p>
